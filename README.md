hackathon-starter-flask-plus
============================

Hackathon starter pack: Flask (with Bootstrap and Jade, easy auth) backend, data munging tools, HTML5 mobile 

Backend
---------

To get the webserver running locally, go into the `backend` directory and see the `README.md` there.

There's an opinionated selection of packages that can be easily installed : 

  * Flask 
  
  * SQlite or MySQL database
  
    * SQLalchemy
    
  * Jade templates (with Jinja)
  
  * Javascript :
  
    * JQuery, JQuery-Mobile, JQuery-tipsy (tooltips), d3.js, googlemaps

  * CSS :
  
    * Bootstrap

One aspect of the backend is the flexibility it has for user accounts, sites and sub-sites.  
This is probably over-kill for a Hackerthon - but the code has all been tested in a live site,
and is (as authentication systems are) rather difficult to disentangle into simpler pieces.



Data
---------

There's a CSV to SQLlite ETL here.
